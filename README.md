# Shimmer for Jetpack Compose & Compose Multiplatform

A library which offers a shimmering effect for Android's Jetpack Compose.

## Setup

The library is available on `mavenCentral()`.

``` kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.valentinilk.shimmer:compose-shimmer:1.2.0")
}
```

## Kotlin Multiplatform

Currently supported KMP targets are:

- Android
- iOS
- JVM (Desktop)
- JS (Browser)

## Quick Start

A simple `shimmer()` modifier is provided, which can be applied like any
other [modifier](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier) in
Compose as well.

As usual, the order of the modifiers matters. Every visual defined **after** the `shimmer()`
modifier will be affected by the animation. This includes child views and other modifiers:

``` kotlin hl_lines="4 5 11"
Box(
  modifier = Modifier
    .size(128.dp)
    .background(Color.Blue)
    .shimmer(),
  contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
  Box(
    modifier = Modifier
      .size(64.dp)
      .background(Color.Red)
  )
}
```

``` kotlin hl_lines="4 5 11"
Box(
  modifier = Modifier
    .size(128.dp)
    .shimmer()
    .background(Color.Blue),
  contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
  Box(
    modifier = Modifier
      .size(64.dp)
      .background(Color.Red)
  )
}
```

## Theming

The library includes a `ShimmerTheme` which can be provided as
a [local composition](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/CompositionLocal).
A good practice would be to integrate the theming into
your [customized MaterialTheme](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/designsystems/custom).
There is no need to wrap every single `shimmer` into a `CompositionLocalProvider`.

``` kotlin
val yourShimmerTheme = defaultShimmerTheme.copy(...)

CompositionLocalProvider(
  LocalShimmerTheme provides yourShimmerTheme
) {
  [...]
}
```

The theme can also be passed as a parameter by using the `rememberShimmer(...)` function, which is
explained further down below.

The theme itself offers a few simple configurations like the shimmer's `rotation` or `width`.
Additionally a few unabstracted objects like an `AnimationSpec` or `BlendMode` are exposed. While
this violates the principales
of [information hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding), it allows for some great
customizations.

For further information have a look at documentation in data class itself and have a look at
the `ThemingSamples` in the sample app.

## Advanced Usage

The default `shimmer()` modifier creates a shimmering animation, which will traverse over the view
in a certain time. That means that the animation will have a different velocity, depending on the
size of the view.

If you apply the modifier to multiple views, each of a different size, then each shimmer will have
its own velocity. This effect can be seen in the following gif:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1201850/131474721-29a57e04-139c-44b6-8721-5fb674706dc8.gif" width="250" >

That might not always be the desired effect, that's why the library offers a way to set the
boundaries for the animation:

```
val shimmerInstance = rememberShimmer(shimmerBounds = ShimmerBounds.XXX)
Box(modifier = Modifier.shimmer(shimmerInstance))
```

### ShimmerBounds.View (default)

The view's height and width will be used as the boundaries for the animation.
This option was used to create the gifs shown above and should be sufficient for most use cases.

### ShimmerBounds.Window

This option uses the window's height, with and coordinate system for the calculations. It will
create a shimmer that travels over the whole window instead of only the views. But only views that
have the shimmer modifier attached will be affected.

Be aware that this option might look odd on scrollable content, because the shimmer will be
positioned relative to the window. So the shimmer will not be moved together with the content.

```
Column {
  val shimmerInstance = rememberShimmer(shimmerBounds = ShimmerBounds.Window)
  Text("Shimmering Text", modifier = Modifier.shimmer(shimmerInstance))
  Text("Non-shimmering Text")
  Text("Shimmering Text", modifier = Modifier.shimmer(shimmerInstance))
}
```

### ShimmerBounds.Custom

The downsides of the `Window` option is why the `ShimmerBounds.Custom` option exists.
By using this option, the shimmer and its content will not be drawn until the bounds are set
manually by using the `updateBounds` method on the `Shimmer`.
This can be used to attach the shimmer to a scrollable list for example. Or simply use the default
`ShimmerBounds.View` option.

```
val shimmerInstance = rememberShimmer(ShimmerBounds.Custom)
Column(
  modifier = Modifier
    .fillMaxSize()
    .verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())
    .onGloballyPositioned { layoutCoordinates ->
      // Util function included in the library
      val position = layoutCoordinates.unclippedBoundsInWindow()
      shimmerInstance.updateBounds(position)
    },
) {
  Text("Shimmering Text", modifier = Modifier.shimmer(shimmerInstance))
  Text("Non-shimmering Text")
  Text("Shimmering Text", modifier = Modifier.shimmer(shimmerInstance))
}
```

Updating the bounds will not trigger a recomposition.

## Custom Modifier

It is also possible to create custom modifiers, if the default one is not convenient enough.
One could, for example, create a modifier that takes in the animation duration as a parameter and
creates the theming on the go. The whole code can be found in the `CustomModifierSample.kt` file in
the sample app.

```
fun Modifier.shimmer(
    duration: Int
): Modifier = composed {
    val shimmer = rememberShimmer(
        shimmerBounds = ShimmerBounds.View,
        theme = createCustomTheme(duration),
    )
     shimmer(customShimmer = shimmer)
}
```

## Sample Apps

Sample apps for different platforms are included in the project.
To use them, clone the repository into a folder locally.

### Android

To run the Android app, simply open the project in Android Studio. Select the `app` configuration and run it.

### iOS

The iOS app can be build and launched by using XCode. Open the `iosApp` folder with XCode as a project. Adapt the
signing in XCode to match your needs and launch the app on an emulator or iOS device.

### Desktop

The desktop app can be launched by using the `demo.desktop` configuration in Android Studio. Or run
`./gradlew :shared:run` in the terminal.

### Browser

To run the sample in the browser, simply use the `demo.browser` configuration in Android Studio. Or run
`./gradlew :shared:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun` in the terminal.
